## 👨‍💻 About Me (자기소개)
**Ph.D. Candidate** in Avionics and Information Engineering at **Korea Aerospace University (KAU)**.

I specialize in **Real-Terrain 3D Modeling** and **Multi-Sensor Fusion** for high-fidelity simulation.
My research integrates **GIS (Geographic Information System)** data into **UAM Network Analysis**, enabling precise communication coverage prediction in complex urban environments compared to simple statistical models.

> "Connecting the sky and the ground with high-reliability intelligence."
