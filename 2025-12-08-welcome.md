## 👋 About Me

**Ph.D. Candidate** in Avionics and Information Engineering at **Korea Aerospace University (KAU)**.

My research focuses on **Sensor Fusion (Radar/RF/Vision)** for drone detection and **UAM (Urban Air Mobility) Communication Analysis**. I aim to design high-reliability autonomous systems by integrating signal processing with deep learning.

> "Ensuring reliability in future mobility networks and sensing systems."
